## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow the steps below to get this project up and running on your local environment.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your development machine:
1.  **.NET 6 SDK:** [Download from the official Microsoft site](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0)
2.  **SQL Server:** The Express or Developer edition is sufficient. [Download here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads)
3.  **Git:** [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
4.  **IDE (Optional but recommended):**
    * Visual Studio 2022
    * Visual Studio Code with the C# extension

### ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-hris-repo.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-hris-repo.git)
    cd your-hris-repo
    ```

2.  **Configure the Database Connection**
    * Open the `appsettings.json` file in the project root.
    * Modify the `ConnectionStrings` section to match your local SQL Server configuration.
    ```json
    "ConnectionStrings": {
      "DefaultConnection": "Server=YOUR_SERVER_NAME;Database=HRIS_Db;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true;Encrypt=False"
    }
    ```
    *Replace `YOUR_SERVER_NAME` with your SQL Server instance name (e.g., `.` or `(localdb)\\mssqllocaldb` or `YOUR-PC\\SQLEXPRESS`).*

3.  **Run Database Migrations**
    * This command will create the database and all necessary tables based on the Entity Framework Core models.
    * Open a terminal in the project directory and run:
    ```bash
    dotnet ef database update
    ```
    *If the `dotnet ef` command is not found, install it globally first: `dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef`*

4.  **Seed Initial Data (Optional)**
    * If your project has a mechanism for seeding initial data (e.g., a default admin user), run the corresponding command. Otherwise, you can add data manually after the application is running.
    ```bash
    # Example if you have a custom seed command
    dotnet run --seed
    ```

5.  **Run the Application**
    * **Via Terminal:**
        ```bash
        dotnet run
        ```
    * **Via Visual Studio:**
        * Open the `.sln` file with Visual Studio.
        * Press `F5` or the "Run" (‚ñ∂) button.

    The application will be running at `https://localhost:XXXX` and `http://localhost:YYYY`. Open a browser and navigate to one of these URLs.
